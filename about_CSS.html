         This document gives an introduction to <em>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</em>,
         including its purpose and structure, and some details about selectors,
         properties, and property values.

      <p>
         <abbr title = "Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>
         is a <em>stylesheet language.</em> A stylesheet is a collection of styles
for <strong>a document</strong> . Styling can range from high-level overall layout
of a document to precise details such as font size. <em>CSS</em> was developed
to work well for Web pages written in <em>HTML</em>. In theory, it is possible
to use other stylesheet languages for styling Web pages, but in practice,
CSS is the only choice.
      </p>
      <p>
         CSS can also be used for other <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> documents.<br>
         Parts of CSS are also used in other technologies.<br>
         CSS properties are used in <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> and <abbr title="eXtensible Stylesheet Language">XSL</abbr>. CSS selectors are used in many
         libraries to select parts of a document. So learning CSS is useful even
         if you are<strong> not</strong> very interested in Web page design.
      </p>
      Separating style (CSS) and structure (HTML markup) of documents is
      important for the following six reasons:
         <ol>
            <li>
               The same style can be used for more than one Web page,
               or even a whole Web site.
            </li>
            <li>
               Web page source is simpler and cleaner, thus easier to read or write.
            </li>
            <li>
               The amount of data to be downloaded when accessing Web pages
            </li>
            <li>
               is smaller.
               Changing the styles on a Web page or a Web site is easier.
               
            </li>
            <li>
               Work can easily be split between Web designers (CSS) and authors
            or programmers (HTML).
            </li>
            <li>
               Different style sheets can be used for screen display, for print,
               and for other cases.
            </li>
         </ol>
      <p>
         CSS is <strong>not</strong> an exact style sheet language. Even with the same style sheet,
         a Web page may look slightly different on different computers and with
         different browsers. For example, not all computers have the
         same fonts. CSS makes it easy to specify only part of the style,
         leaving the rest to the browser.

      <h2 id="history">A Very Short History of CSS</h2>
      <p>
         CSS was created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A5kon_Wium_Lie">HÃ¥kon Wium Lie </a>and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bert_Bos">Bert Bos</a> at <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>. There were originally
         many different proposals for how styling should be handled, but eventually
         CSS won. Today, the CSS specification is split into many modules that can
         be on different levels.
      </p>
   </aside>

   <section>
      <h2 id="example">
         A Simple Example
      </h2>
      <p>
         This is a simple CSS stylesheet:
      </p>
      <pre>
body { font-size: 14pt; font-family: serif; line-height: 120%;
       background-color: lightgreen;
}
h1 { font-size: 130%; font-weight: bold; }
h2 { font-size: 120%; margin-before: 0.5em; }
h3 { font-size: 110%; }
p  { text-indent: 1.5em; }
aside { float: right; width: 40%; font-size: 90%; }
      </pre>
      <p>
         This stylesheet has 6 style rules. The first rule says that the body
         font size is 14 points, the font should have serifs, the line height
         is 120% of the font size (i.e. there is a 20% interline space), and
         the background color is light green.
      </p>
   </section>
   <section>
      <h2 id="syntax">
         Basic Syntax
      </h2>
      <p>
         The main elements of the CSS syntax are selectors, properties, and
         property values. A CSS stylesheet is a collection of rules.
         Each rule consists of some selector(s) and a declaration block in brackets.
         A declaration block contains some declarations, separated or terminated
         by semicolons. A declaration consists of a property name and a property
         value.
      </p>      
      <p>
      In the above example, body and h1 are examples of selectors.
      <code>{ font-size: 110%; }</code> is a declaration block. <code>Background-color: #FCF</code> and
      <code>margin-before: 0.5em</code> are declarations. <code>font-weight</code> and <code>float</code> are
      property names. <code>14pt</code>, <code>bold</code>, and <code>90%</code> are property values.
      </p>
      <p>
      
      Comments can be included in CSS. They start with /* and end with */.
      This is the same as in the programming language C. But CSS does not
      support // comments the way most modern C compilers do.
      </p>
      <p>
      Parsing of CSS is tolerant to unknown selectors, property names,
      and property values. This makes it easy to introduce new properties.
      When using a new property, stylesheet designers have to be careful
      that the stylesheet still works well on browsers that do not support
      the new property.
      </p>
   </section>
   <section>
      <h2 id="selectors">Selectors</h2>
      <p>
         Selectors define where the style in the following declaration block
         is applied.
      </p>
      <p>
         The following table gives examples of the main types of
         selectors and their meaning:
      </p>
      <table>
         <tbody>
            <tr>
               <th>selector example </th>
               <th>selector type </th>
               <th>applicability</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td>*</td>
               <td>universal selector </td>
               <td>matches any element</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td>
                  body 
               </td>
               <td>
                  element name  
               </td>
               <td>element content (and all its subelements)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td>.warning</td>
               <td>class selector </td>
               <td>elements with class='warning'</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td>#syntax</td>
               <td>id selector </td>
               <td>element with id='syntax'</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td>a:link</td>
               <td>link pseudoclass</td>
               <td>link that is not yet visited</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td> a:visited </td>
               <td>link pseudoclass</td>
               <td>link that was visited</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td> p code </td>
               <td> descendant</td>
               <td>code element somewhere in p</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td></td>
               <td>  combinator</td>
               <td></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
               <td>p > code </td>
               <td>  child combinator</td>
               <td>code element that is a child of p</td>
            </tr>   
         </tbody>
      </table>

         More selectors can be found in Selectors Level 3.

   <section>
      <h2 id="property"> Property      </h2>
      <p>
         Properties indicate what kind of style setting should be done. There are
properties for margins, borders, fonts, colors, backgrounds, columns, grids,
scrolling, animation, relative and absolute positioning, and many more.
Properties often come in groups, for example font, font-family, font-size,
font-weight, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
         Cascading Style Sheets, level 1 started with about 50 properties. The
CSS Snapshot 2018 lists close to 300 properties. You can use the
caniuse.com Web site to find out on which browsers and which versions
of a browser a property is supported.
      </p>
   </section>

   <section>
      <h2 id="propertyValue">
         Property Values
      </h2>
      <p>
         Property values define the exact setting of a property. Many properties
have the same or similar property values, e.g. for colors and sizes.
      </p>
      <p>
         There are two ways to indicate colors, by name and numerically.
Color names come from a long list defined in CSS Color Module Level 3.
Numerical color values can be of the form #rgb or #rrggbb or rgb(r,g,b).
There are also notations for other color spaces such as RGBA and HSL.
      </p>
      <p>
         Sizes can be absolute or relative. They are defined in
CSS Values and Units Module Level 3. Absolute sizes can
units such as pt (points), cm, or mm. Relative sizes can be expressed
in percent (%) or em (the height of an uppercase M).
      </p>
      <p>
         There are many other kinds of property values.
Please check which property values can be used with which property.

      <h2>How to Apply CSS to HTML</h2>
      <p>

         There are several different ways to apply CSS to HTML. The best way is
         to have external style sheets and to link them to HTML with the
         link element in the head element. The following is an example:
      </p>
      <p>
         A second way is to include some style rules in a style element in the
         head element of an HTML document. A third way is to add some declarations
         in a style attribute on a specific element. These ways are only suited
         for specific local style settings, and are <strong>not</strong> recommended. But they take
         priority over external stylesheet settings.
      </p>
   </section>
   <section>
      <h2>Cascading</h2>
      <p>
         We finally come to the explanation of the 'C' in CSS. CSS stylesheets
         work by cascading. The same property can be set to different values
         on the same text. Such settings can come from different style sheets,
         style elements, and style attributes. They can come from outer elements
         (such as the body element) or from inner elements. They can apply to an
         element, a class, or an id. They can come from a shorthand property that
         sets several related properties together or from a more specific property.
         They can also come from an author stylesheet, a user stylesheet, or a
         browser stylesheet.
      </p>
      <p>
         All these settings are cascaded. Longer selectors win over shorter selectors.
         Inner settings win over outer settings. Later settings (e.g. in the same
         stylesheet) win over earlier settings. Understanding these precedences,
         one can write short and precise stylesheets.
      </p>
   </section>
   <aside>
      <h2>SCSS</h2>
      <p>
         CSS does not allow to nest selectors and declaration blocks.
         For large style sheets, such nesting can be convenient.
         SCSS is an extension of CSS to provide nesting and some other
         additional features. Browsers do not understand it, so SCSS
         has to be converted to CSS on the server side.
